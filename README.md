# Projects 
Overview of the three past projects. 
# [Project 1: AWS Analysis pipelines](https://github.com/mortazavidk/AWS_Analysis_Pipelines.git)
In this project 7 pipelines for the real-time, near real-time and batch analysis of a large scale dataset are implemented using AWS ecosystem and Python Language.   
- Pipeline 1: Data Lake, this pipeline ingests the real-time generation of the log data and store it in AWS data lake.  
- Pipeline 2: Order History, this pipeline provides access to the generated order data for mobile client applications. 
- Pipeline 3: Abnormal Orders, this pipeline monitors orders, analyses the abnormal orders and notifies the user. 
- Pipeline 4: Recommended Product, this pipeline analyses the historical order data to recommend a related product.
- Pipeline 5: Searching Logs, this pipeline provides a fast search ability for the continuously generated log data.
- Pipeline 6: Query Lake: this pipeline provides the SQL interface for the consumption of data in the data lake interactively.  
- Pipeline 7: Visualizing lake, this pipeline visualizes processed data to get insight.

# [Project 2: Analysing Big Data streams in Cloud](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-019-02908-2)
In this project a framework is desgined and implemeted for the efficient analysis of Big data stream using public CLoud resources.   
- Five algorithms were desgined, implemented and evaluated using real case scenarios.
- All framework's modules were implemented using Java and Python languages.
- Improved the efficiency of the analysis up to 41%

# [Project 3: Analysing Big Data streams on promise](https://content.iospress.com/articles/intelligent-data-analysis/ida173691)
In this project a framework is desgined and implemeted for the efficient analysis of Big data stream using cluster resources.   
- Improved the efficiency of the analysis up to 65%
- A Distributed cluster of 32 computing nodes was implemented using Linux, Storm, Java and Python.
- All evaluations were executed on the implemented cluster using real world scenarios.
